# grammars-v3

A collection of [Antlr3](http://www.antlr3.org/) grammars, from [http://www.antlr3.org/grammar/list.html](http://www.antlr3.org/grammar/list.html)

Expectation that the grammars are free of actions but it's not a hard and fast rule. There is no common license!

Beware of the licenses on the individual grammars. **THERE IS NO COMMON
LICENSE!** When in doubt or you don't know what you're doing, please use
the BSD or MIT license.

Warning
------------

These are legacy Antlr3 grammars.  Many have not been updated for the latest version of Antlr3, and may fail to parse using the latest Antlr3.  The grammars that parse properly are those that are not commented out in the root `pom.xml`

Testing the Grammars
------------

The directory /support/antlr3test-maven-plugin contains a maven plugin which compiles the grammars and then runs them against examples in the /examples subdirectory to verify that the grammars compile and produce a clean parse for each example.

To use the plugin, you will have to compile and install it.

<pre>
cd support/
mvn clean package install
</pre>

You can then test all grammars:

<pre>
mvn clean test
</pre>
